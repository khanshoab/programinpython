# one dimensional array or one D array
# eg. student roll no [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# one row and multiple column


#multidimensional array or multi D array
#eg. student subject marks
#[27,84,67,74,63] 1st student marks
#[74,94,87,35,95] 2nd student marks
# multiplse rows and multiples column


# but by default python does not support multi dimensional array
# but we can use third party package like numpy
